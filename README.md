# My name is Avery Taylor and this is my portfolio website!
The process for developing my portfolio site was tedious to say the least, web development is not my strength so I definitely had some challenges along the way. I started building mobile-first, and then expanded from there. I focused on the HTML and CSS first, ensuring all the content was where it needed to be. Then I began to explore Bootstrap and eventually Animate.css to see what they had to offer to make my job easier. The biggest roadblock I dealt with during the creation of this site was making use of the Bootstrap grid to place the content on my site. I am still not overly experienced with Bootstrap so this was definitely a struggle. Thankfully, there are many online resources that helped me greatly. I think the funniest part of this whole project was when I found an article on W3Schools that explained Bootstrap concepts better than Bootstrap itself. Something I learned while working on this was that sometimes sacrifices have to be made to make sure your code works properly. In my case, there were times where I wanted to use certain Bootstrap concepts like cards for example, but because I couldn't get them to work the way I needed them to I had to make the choice to cut it from my final design. Overall this was a fun challenge that would've been a lot more stressful without Bootstrap to help me. I definitely enjoyed the creative freedom I had with this and although I didn't get to add all the small details I wanted to, I am still very pleased with the final product.
